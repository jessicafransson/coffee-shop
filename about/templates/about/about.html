        <div class="col-md-6 mt-4 mt-md-0">
            <p><strong>Coffee Shop</strong> was founded in the city center of Malm√∂, Sweden. 
                We are founders that love a good cup of coffee, and our customers.</p>

            <p>We keep a simple attitude towards our lovely coffee, <strong>but we accept no shortcuts</strong>
                We purchase 100% specialty coffee from individual farms, plantations and cooperatives. 
                A lot of our beans also come from ecologically certified producers.
                Many of our coffees come from organically certified producers, but many also come from smaller growers, 
                where certification is not an economic and practical possibility.
            <br>
                But <strong>we still support them when the coffee is good</strong>, there are often many good intentions behind each grower, 
                especially those who work with quality.
                They are afraid of their own land, and avoid expensive artificial fertilizers if they can.</p>

                <p><strong>Our own coffee farm</strong> is located in Coffee, Colombia. We purchased this farm in the late 2018 to really learn about coffee.
                We have travelled in a lot of countries big with coffee to learn, improve and realise the hard work that lies behind the perfect pour of coffee.
            <br>
                This is something else, this is our way of constantly learning, and improving our skills about this magical bean. 
                Our mission is <strong>how do we develop this farm to a sustainable specialty coffee farm?</strong>
